Idea:

Dog collar that detects if the dog is too near to restricted objects e.g Water

Input/Outputs:
-Camera
-Proximity sensor
-Speaker

How it converts from bits to atom:

The camera detects a particular colour and the proximity sensor emits an electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation and look for changes in the field which determine the distance between the object and the dog. This result will be processed to calculate the threshold before a high frequency sound will be emitted by the speakers to warn the dog not to get close.
